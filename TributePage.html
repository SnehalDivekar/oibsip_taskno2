    <h2> Biography</h2>


    <p>  Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam   was an Indian aerospace scientist who served as the 11th president 
        of India from 2002 to 2007. He was born and raised in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu and studied physics and aerospace 
        engineering.  He spent the next four decades as a scientist and science administrator, mainly at the Defence 
        Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately
        involved in India's civilian space programme and military missile development efforts. He thus came to be known 
        as the Missile Man of India for his work on the development of ballistic missile and launch vehicle technology.
        He also played a pivotal organisational, technical, and political role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in
        1998, the first since the original nuclear test by India in 1974.  Kalam was elected as the 11th president of 
         India in 2002 with the support of both the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party and the then-opposition Indian National 
        Congress. Widely referred to as the "People's President", he returned to his civilian life of education, writing
         and public service after a single term. He was a recipient of several prestigious awards, including the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian honour.
